# indicatordashboard

You will need 3 api keys to run this app:

- API_KEY from www.alphavantage.co
- REGISTRATION_KEY from api.bls.gov
- KEY from api.eia.gov

My environmental variable names are lazy, sorry about that.

To kick off the application use
```
python manage.py runserver
```
from the root directory
